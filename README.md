# Window Mangler

These are scripts based on the original [wmutils scripts](https://github.com/wmutils/contrib).

lad and wm are originally based on [yawee](http://git.z3bra.org/scripts/file/yawee.html) and [groaw](http://git.z3bra.org/scripts/file/groaw.html), respectively


### TODO
1. Better documentation.
